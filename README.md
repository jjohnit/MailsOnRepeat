# MailsOnRepeat

This C# console project created using .NET 6 can repeatedly send a specific mail to a set of recipients repeatedly. You can provide the recipients list and the number of mails you want to send, in the console.
The story behind this project was that I was getting spam mails from employees of a company and I continued getting them even after requesting them not to send them.
I just wanted them to taste thier own medicine.
